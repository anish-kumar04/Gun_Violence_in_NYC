# Gun_Violence_in_NYC

In this project I created different visualizations using the Gun Violence Data of New York City. The Data is available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data.

The dataset is a collection of reported shooting incidents in New York City from 2006 to 2022.
